# naive-bayes-classifier
These are two short programs in R which I have made for my dissertation. They are built for the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database, which is available in R and was created by Dr. WIlliam H. Wolberg (1992), https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Original%29.
nbclassifier.r is a Naive Bayes Classifier built from scratch and is based on code by Matthias C. M. Troffaes (2014), https://gist.github.com/mcmtroffaes/8750237. 
confusionmatrix.r is code which creates a confusion matrix from scratch in R.
